# Mobile-Price-Range-Prediction
The smartphone industry has been steadily developing and growing, both in terms of market size and models. Globally, 40% of the world's population is predicted to own a smartphone. According to Ericsson, the number of smartphone subscriptions worldwide surpasses six billion and is expected to grow by several hundred million in the next few years further. China, India, and United States are the countries with the highest number of smartphone users. In this massively booming market it becomes very important to fix a price for a new model any company decides to launch. The price should not only maximize profits for company, but also justify the tag in competing market. Our goal here is to build a Classification ML model to predict the justified rank of price range for new models to launch.
